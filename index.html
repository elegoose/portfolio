      <div class="text-entry">

        <p>I started coding as a self-taught learner during high school, initially driven by my interest in creating
          game
          mods. My first programming language was Python, which sparked my passion for programming. </p>
        <p> Currently, I'm
          studying Computer Science at <a href="https://uchile.cl/english" target="_blank">University
            of Chile</a>, with a focus on areas like IoT, DevOps, Web Development,
          and Ethical Hacking.</p>
        <p>In addition to programming, I’ve become deeply invested in Linux and use Arch with Sway as my window manager.
          Customizing my desktop environment to perfectly suit my needs has, funnily enough, become a bit of a hobby,
          and I enjoy spending time tinkering with my setup.</p>
        <p>I also manage my own Linux server, which I use for personal projects and sometimes to host dedicated game
          servers for friends.</p>
        <p>When I’m not immersed in tech, I enjoy reading <i>manga</i>, playing video games, going to the cinema,
          discovering new music (<a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/~elegoose">my RYM profile</a>), hiking, or just chatting with my friends.</p>
